\newglossaryentry{feedback}{name=Feedback, description={
    "... feedback is conceptualized as information provided by an agent
    (e.g., teacher, peer, book, parent, self, experience) regarding aspects of one’s per- formance or understanding.
    A teacher or parent can provide corrective information, a peer can provide an alternative strategy,
    a book can provide information to clarify ideas, a parent can provide encouragement,
    and a learner can look up the answer to evaluate the correctness of a response.
    Feedback thus is a “consequence” of performance." \footnote{Hattie, J., \& Timperley, H. (2007). The Power of Feedback. Review of Educational Research, 77(1), 81–-112.}}
